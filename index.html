         The Appalachian Trail is a blaze-marked footpath that extends over 2000 miles 
         along the ridges, hills, and highlands that comprise the Appalachian Mountain 
         range in the eastern portion of the United States. The A. T., as it is known 
         among hikers, is really a network of interconnected trails, roads, sidewalks, 
         bridges, and even a river that one must ferry across by canoe. Avid hikers and 
         backpackers flock to the A. T., and many try to complete the entire trail in 
         one epic push known as a “thru-hike”. In early March, 2017 my wife, Charle, 
         our dog, Bridger, and I set out on an attempted Thru-Hike of the A. T.

               Springer Mountain in Georgia is the southern terminus of the A. T., and 
               hikers attempting a thru-hike beginning in Georgia headed north are referred 
               to as northbounders, or NOBOs.. Alternatively, hikers beginning their hike 
               in the north headed south are called SOBOs. Our journey began in the south, 
               thus we were NOBOs.

               There are 76 miles of A. T. in Georgia. The vast majority of NOBO hikers 
               starting a thru-hike begin here in early spring. March is the busiest time 
               on the trail in GA. Many think of hiking the Appalachian Trail as being an 
               exercise in solitude, and it certainly can be, but at any given time there 
               are between 50 and 100 fellow thru-hikers within a few miles of you. This 
               is known as a “bubble”. You get to know the hikers in your bubble pretty 
               well. The A. T. has a justified reputation among long trails as having a 
               really strong community. The Georgia section really gives a fledgling thru
               -hiker a taste of that community.

               The weather swings dramatically on the A. T. in general, but March is another 
               beast altogether. Down in Georgia we enjoyed sunny, 70 degree days, and we 
               endured snow, ice, and sub 0 temps. Crossing into North Carolina was a bitter-
               sweet victory. Crossing state lines while on the A. T. usually puts wind in 
               your sails. The day we crossed into NC was our hardest day yet. The cold had 
               us frozen to the bone, and the wind bore right through our clothing. The 
               trail was covered all over in icy, crusty snow that made the going slow. We 
               encountered some of the biggest up-hill climbs on the day we passed into NC. 
               It was a tough start, but crossing the 100 mile mark gave us resolve, and 
               besides, all that suffering came with an equal amount of beauty.

               The trail disregards the North Carolina/Tennessee border. It weaved across it 
               so many times we lost count. The only border boost we got in this section was 
               crossing into and out of our nation’s most visited national park; the Great 
               Smoky Mountains National Park. The park doesn’t allow dogs on trails, so we 
               had to board Bridger for a week while we hiked. It was odd not having our trail 
               buddy with us, but we were able to cover more miles more quickly, and we knew 
               he would be enjoying his little break.

               On the A. T., Virginia is hands down the single state with the most miles. 
               Over 540 miles of trail run from the border with Tennessee in the south up 
               to West Virginia in the north. With so many miles comes so many milestones.

               Our first milestone was crossing the 500 mile mark in Grayson Highlands State 
               Park. 500 miles is a big number for a hiker. It is the number that distinguishes 
               a “long-distance” hiker from a regular hiker. Arbitrary, I know, but it is similar 
               to how an “ultra-marathoner” is distinguished from a marathoner.

               A less happy milestone was when we sent Bridger to stay with Charle’s parents 
               in Wisconsin. Before setting out on our thru-hike we had made plans for Bridger 
               if he couldn’t finish the trail with us. Thru-hiking is really, really tough 
               on the human body, and just as hard on a dog’s body.  Every day hiking with 
               Bridger we had to stay in tune with his health and needs. Most days he was great, 
               keeping up and enjoying the trail. Other days, we could tell he was as roughed 
               up as we were. Hiking in the Shenandoah National Park was hot, and we could tell 
               Bridger was done. It was sad saying goodbye to our best buddy, but it was the 
               right choice for all of us. Bridger spent the rest of the summer living the lazy 
               dog life. For us, logistics became much simpler. We could now sit-down in a 
               restaurant instead of having to order out. Our lodging options multiplied, and we 
               no longer had to carry Bridger’s extra weight.

                  Though the mileage passing through West Virginia is a just a blip, only 4, 
                  this state important as it is considered to be the spiritual half-way point 
                  to most thru-hikers. Harper’s Ferry, WV is home to the Appalachian Trail 
                  Conservancy, the non-profit tasked with advocating for the trail. It is a 
                  ritual for thru-hikers to pass through the ATC building, and get their photo 
                  added to the roster of that year’s thru-hiker class.

               Passing into the mid-atlantic states means passing into more high population 
               areas. Maryland was mostly a series of road-crossings and really easy trails. 
               Our bellies loved the road crossings since we could usually find some good 
               food nearby, and our legs loved the easy trails.

               in high population centers make these states a great cruise section. New

               New York is very similar to New Jersey except the trail becomes giant granite

               Connecticut was one of my favorite states. The trail was wonderful, flat and 
               following water most of the way. The communities we passed through were filled 
               with supportive, friendly folk. The best part of our time in the state 
               was getting to see a couple of our best friends, Amy and Kyle, who drove all 
               the way out from Wisconsin to hike and spend time with us. That joy was tempered 
               by the fact that we would no longer be hiking with Tina and Molly. They got 
               ahead of us, and we would not be able to catch up to them.

               Massachusetts was much like Connecticut except the hill climbs started 
               getting steeper. It was good preparation for what was to come in Vermont.

               Crossing into Vermont is getting back into the wild and rugged aspects of trail 
               life. Vermont is home to the Long Trail, a 272 mile footpath that begins at the 
               Massachusetts border in the south and runs north all the way to the Canadian 
               border. The A. T. joins the Long Trail for the first 100 miles. These are some 
               of the tougher miles on the A. T. as hikers enter into the Green Mountains. The 
               climbs are steep and long, getting up into Boreal and sub-Alpine forests. A 
               nickname for the state is “Ver-mud” as the low sections are often feet-deep mud 
               pits. We slowed down in Vermont not only because of the physical difficulty of 
               thru-hiking in the state, but also because of its beauty. A normal schedule on 
               the A. T. means hiking a certain number of miles each day to make it to a certain 
               camping area or town at a certain time. In Vermont we would set up camp early if 
               we found a particular area inviting enough. There are many mountain brooks in the 
               Green Mountains, and when one is thru-hiking, cool water is so inviting!

               NOBO thru-hikers crossing into New Hampshire have gone through a lot. The 
               Green Mountains in Vermont are training for the White Mountains in New 
               Hampshire. Luckily, the border town, Hanover offers hikes a well deserved 
               rest. There are a handful of “trail towns” the A. T. passes through. Each 
               has its unique level of hospitality, amenities, and overall charm. Hanover 
               was my favorite trail town. It was the perfect respite before climbing into 
               the White Mountains.

               The White Mountains in New Hampshire are kind of a big deal. The trail climbs 
               true alpine peaks here where one must keep a close eye on the weather. Up 
               above the treeline you are in an environment unsheltered from lightning, hail, 
               fierce winds, and fog that can be absolutely blinding. The crown jewel of the 
               range is Mount Washington, which, for decades, held the record for strongest 
               recorded wind speeds not associated with a cyclonic storm. Many people have 
               succumbed to the elements here. The range is beautiful, but it is equally 
               dangerous.

               For a NOBO thru-hiker, Mount Katahdin in Maine is the ultimate goal. Crossing 
               into the final state means you have hiked nearly 2000 miles, and have fewer 
               than 300 to go. That final stretch is some of the toughest mileage there is. 
               Maine is a wilderness state, and the A. T. is routed through some of the more 
               remote areas within that state. It is a grand challenge, one that NOBOs have 
               walked a long way to experience. Of all the miles we walked the hardest and 
               most rewarding were in Maine.
