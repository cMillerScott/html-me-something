         The Appalachian Trail is a blaze-marked footpath that extends over 2000 miles 
         along the ridges, hills, and highlands that comprise the Appalachian Mountain 
         range in the eastern portion of the United States. The A. T., as it is known 
         among hikers, is really a network of interconnected trails, roads, sidewalks, 
         bridges, and even a river that one must ferry across by canoe. Avid hikers and 
         backpackers flock to the A. T., and many try to complete the entire trail in 
         one epic push known as a “thru-hike”. In early March, 2017 my wife, Charle, 
         our dog, Bridger, and I set out on an attempted Thru-Hike of the A. T.

               Springer Mountain in Georgia is the southern terminus of the A. T., and 
               hikers attempting a thru-hike beginning in Georgia headed north are referred 
               to as northbounders, or NOBOs.. Alternatively, hikers beginning their hike 
               in the north headed south are called SOBOs. Our journey began in the south, 
               thus we were NOBOs.

               There are 76 miles of A. T. in Georgia. The vast majority of NOBO hikers 
               starting a thru-hike begin here in early spring. March is the busiest time 
               on the trail in GA. Many think of hiking the Appalachian Trail as being an 
               exercise in solitude, and it certainly can be, but at any given time there 
               are between 50 and 100 fellow thru-hikers within a few miles of you. This 
               is known as a “bubble”. You get to know the hikers in your bubble pretty 
               well. The A. T. has a justified reputation among long trails as having a 
               really strong community. The Georgia section really gives a fledgling thru
               -hiker a taste of that community.

               The weather swings dramatically on the A. T. in general, but March is another 
               beast altogether. Down in Georgia we enjoyed sunny, 70 degree days, and we 
               endured snow, ice, and sub 0 temps. Crossing into North Carolina was a bitter-
               sweet victory. Crossing state lines while on the A. T. usually puts wind in 
               your sails. The day we crossed into NC was our hardest day yet. The cold had 
               us frozen to the bone, and the wind bore right through our clothing. The 
               trail was covered all over in icy, crusty snow that made the going slow. We 
               encountered some of the biggest up-hill climbs on the day we passed into NC. 
               It was a tough start, but crossing the 100 mile mark gave us resolve, and 
               besides, all that suffering came with an equal amount of beauty.

               The trail disregards the North Carolina/Tennessee border. It weaved across it 
               so many times we lost count. The only border boost we got in this section was 
               crossing into and out of our nation’s most visited national park; the Great 
               Smoky Mountains National Park. The park doesn’t allow dogs on trails, so we 
               had to board Bridger for a week while we hiked. It was odd not having our trail 
               buddy with us, but we were able to cover more miles more quickly, and we knew 
               he would be enjoying his little break.

               On the A. T., Virginia is hands down the single state with the most miles. 
               Over 540 miles of trail run from the border with Tennessee in the south up 
               to West Virginia in the north. With so many miles comes so many milestones.

               Our first milestone was crossing the 500 mile mark in Grayson Highlands State 
               Park. 500 miles is a big number for a hiker. It is the number that distinguishes 
               a “long-distance” hiker from a regular hiker. Arbitrary, I know, but it is similar 
               to how an “ultra-marathoner” is distinguished from a marathoner.

               A less happy milestone was when we sent Bridger to stay with Charle’s parents 
               in Wisconsin. Before setting out on our thru-hike we had made plans for Bridger 
               if he couldn’t finish the trail with us. Thru-hiking is really, really tough 
               on the human body, and just as hard on a dog’s body.  Every day hiking with 
               Bridger we had to stay in tune with his health and needs. Most days he was great, 
               keeping up and enjoying the trail. Other days, we could tell he was as roughed 
               up as we were. Hiking in the Shenandoah National Park was hot, and we could tell 
               Bridger was done. It was sad saying goodbye to our best buddy, but it was the 
               right choice for all of us. Bridger spent the rest of the summer living the lazy 
               dog life. For us, logistics became much simpler. We could now sit-down in a 
               restaurant instead of having to order out. Our lodging options multiplied, and we 
               no longer had to carry Bridger’s extra weight.
